Election Data Project
  This dataset is the results of the 2012 political polls. I analyzed this aggregated poll data
  and answered the following questions.
    
    1. Who was being polled and what was their party affiliation?
    2. Did the poll results favor Romney or Obama?
    4. Can we account for undecided voters?
    5. How did voter setniment change over time?
    6. CAn we see an effect in the polls from the debate?
